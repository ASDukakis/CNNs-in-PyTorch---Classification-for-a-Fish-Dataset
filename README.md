# CNNs-in-PyTorch---Classification-for-a-Fish-Dataset

*disclaimer - readme mostly copied from my notebook intro because im lazy :)*

This is a relatively simple personal project I set myself to get acquainted with using PyTorch and its various libraries to build a basic CNN image classifier. I arbitrarily chose a dataset off kaggle that can be accessed (as of the time of writing) [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowww/a-large-scale-fish-dataset/).

This dataset contains images of fish categorized into 9 distinct classes:

- Hourse Mackerel  
- Black Sea Sprat  
- Sea Bass  
- Red Mullet  
- Trout  
- Striped Red Mullet  
- Shrimp  
- Gilt-Head Bream  
- Red Sea Bream  

The objective of this project is to be able to classify images of fish into one of these categories. That being said, as mentioned prior, this is primarily an exercise to familiarize myself with using PyTorch for basic CV applications and perhaps for my own future reference. 

NOTE: Since this is mostly for my personal use, I've slapped together some pretty barebones description/commenting so apologies if anyone else is reading this :)

This repo inclues the project notebook, the dataset as well as two trained models which scored accuracies of ~99% and 97% respectively.
